% Program for creating a linear index useful for the construction of a compass on a conical support
% The program can be modified and adapted for the construction of other types of numeric indexes.
% The font used is OCR-B which allows to have alphabetic and numeric symbols very similar
% to those used in analogue flight gauges in the 50s and 80s
% You must have installed OCR-B in OTF format that has a GPL-2 and later compatible license.
% The font is present in the texlive-fonts-extra package
% 
% Explanation:
%
% \documentclass{standalone} is particular class that non have a size, but the size is define from
% the document itself
\documentclass[tikz,margin=0pt]{standalone}
% \usepackage{tikz} is the package that contain the graphics command as \draw etc ...
% The package is describe in this document: https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/TikZ_package
\usepackage{tikz}
% If the graduate dials is for analogical gauges period 50-70 years, this font is ok
% OCR is open-source package deposited in the CTAN repository: https://www.ctan.org/pkg/ocr-b
% Opentype can be used on Linux and Mac machines
% (I do not know if it's possible in Windows, but I think of it),
% you can always download it from the CTAN site at this address:
% https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/ocr-b-outline
\usepackage{ocr}
\tikzset{font={\fontsize{12pt}{10}\selectfont}}
% Defines the font size to use, the first number defines the font size,
% the second number the dimensional family from which the font is taken.
% It can be assumed that there are differences between a dimensional family 10 and a 12 dimensional font.
