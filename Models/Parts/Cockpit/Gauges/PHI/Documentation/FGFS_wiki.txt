Used, in the 50s-70s of the last century, for both commercial and military aircraft. This mechanical analog instrument made it possible to follow a route with 4 preset points of XY coordinates with respect to the coordinates of the starting point (X = 0.0, Y = 0.0). <BR> The use of this system was quite simple and was based on the integration of the path taken by an aircraft by constantly measuring its speed and its angle as a function of North obtained through a gyrocompass aligned with true North.<BR>The accuracy of the instrument was around 1.5%, therefore equivalent to 1.5 miles every 100 miles traveled.<BR>To obtain such accuracy it was necessary to use a ground speed detection system using a doppler radar and a well aligned gyrocompass. If the doppler radar was unable to obtain the correct speed (e.g. position of the aircraft too close to the ground (<500 ft) or an excessive inclination (> 42 °) in the turn, the measurement was automatically replaced by the measurement of the TAS obtained using the anemometer and an altimeter dedicated only to this purpose.

A second pitot tube was therefore needed, which distinguished aircraft equipped with this system. The system was created using a sophisticated mechanical computer for determining the relative coordinates of the aircraft during the flight. The integration of the coordinates with the TAS (True Air Speed) was obtained through a mechanical sphere integrator and an analogue calculation circuit for the correction of the component due to the wind.

The weak element of the system was the correct determination of the wind speed, as the doppler radar was unable to obtain this measurement. This problem was particularly felt in transoceanic flight, in which the wind component, especially at high quete, was an extremely relevant factor that could lead to a much higher error. In this case a realignment work was needed by the navigator through the use of a sextant.

In tactical flight, such as that normally performed by the G91R1B, wind speed was a less important factor, but it could still reduce, in an often unacceptable way, the accuracy of the route to be taken. For this reason, as soon as the inertial platforms were available, the PHI disappeared in the use of navigation systems for both civil and military aviation.

Wanting to accurately reproduce the FIAT G91RB aircraft, we wanted to simulate a fully functional PHI to increase the realism of the flight and to better understand the real problems that a pilot had to solve with the use of this sophisticated system.

PHI is managed by four devices:

# - The direction and distance indicator
# - The gauge for entering wind direction and intensity
# - The Doppler system control panel
# - The panel for switching the stored routes

====The direction and distance indicator====

This gauge is quite complex and allows you to control various functions of the PHI.<BR> At the top left there is the knob for activating the device, as in reality only three positions are active in the G91:
* HOLD: Turns off / on the display device, but not the integration system which is controlled by another panel.
* PHI: Activates the PHI mode, in this mode the thicker arrow (the one in the photo is at 66 °) indicates the direction, compared to magnetic north (that of the compass), which the plane will have to follow to reach the point established.
* PS: Gyro compass heading mode. This compass is much more accurate and stable than the magnetic compass of the airplane.
