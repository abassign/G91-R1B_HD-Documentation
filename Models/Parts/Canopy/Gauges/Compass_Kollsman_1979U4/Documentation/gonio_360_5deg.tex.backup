% Program for creating a linear index useful for the construction of a compass on a conical support
% The program can be modified and adapted for the construction of other types of numeric indexes.
% The font used is OCR-B which allows to have alphabetic and numeric symbols very similar to those used in analogue flight gauges in the 50s and 80s
% You must have installed OCR-B in OTF format that has a GPL-2 and later compatible license.
% The font for Debian-Ubuntu systems can be downloaded as a ``texlive-fonts-extra'' package
