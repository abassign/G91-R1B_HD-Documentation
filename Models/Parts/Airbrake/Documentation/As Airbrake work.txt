Fiorello Lello Pittino (G91 tech) respond to Adriano Bassignana:
I give you the exact values of the opening angle of the airbrakes of the G ... 42 ° 30 '+/- 2 ° ... this is the max value, but depending on the speed it can also be lower , since, being the hydraulic jack equipped with an overpressure valve that deviates towards the tank the hydraulic oil if in the circuit the value of 3982 PSI or 280Kg / cm2 is exceeded. For this reason the A / F can be extracted at any speed. and, if the limiter intervenes, the effect will always be very effective, because it is true that it is a little closed, but it is also true that at higher speeds the effect is greater. On the other hand it would be unintelligent not to be able to use at high speed an instrument that was born to reduce it ...... it is like saying that on a car the brake servo should be used only at low speed .... do not you find? in the hope of being useful ... hello!
